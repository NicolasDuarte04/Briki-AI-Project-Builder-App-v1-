# Insurance Cards Rendering Fix Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Tool Response Structure (chat/route.ts)
- Updated the `get_insurance_plans` tool to return the exact structure expected by the frontend
- Now returns: `id`, `name`, `provider`, `base_price` (numeric), `base_price_formatted`, `currency`, `benefits`, `category`, `rating`, `external_link`, `is_external`
- Previously was returning a simplified structure that didn't match frontend validation

### 2. Currency Conversion to COP (render-db.ts)
- Modified `formatCurrencyValue` to convert USD/EUR to COP automatically
- USD → COP: multiplies by 4000
- EUR → COP: multiplies by 4400
- All prices now display as "X.XXX COP" format
- Set currency field to always return 'COP' for frontend consistency

### 3. Updated AI System Prompt (chat/route.ts)
- Removed instruction to return JSON structure in messages
- AI now describes plans conversationally and mentions interactive cards
- This prevents the AI from printing plans as markdown lists

### 4. Enhanced MessageRenderer (MessageRenderer.tsx)
- Added support for `toolInvocations` prop to handle tool results directly
- Added logic to check for tool invocations before parsing message content
- Improved debug logging to show tool invocations count
- This should help with immediate rendering of cards

### 5. Updated AIAssistantInterface
- Now passes `toolInvocations` to MessageRenderer component
- This allows the renderer to access tool results directly from the message

## What These Changes Fix

1. **Cards Not Rendering**: The frontend validation was failing because the tool response didn't include required fields like `base_price` (numeric), `currency`, and `external_link`. Now all required fields are present.

2. **USD/EUR Prices**: All prices are now converted to COP on the fly, ensuring consistent Colombian peso display.

3. **Markdown Lists Instead of Cards**: The AI was instructed to return JSON, causing it to print the data. Now it speaks naturally while the cards render automatically.

4. **Delayed Rendering**: By checking `toolInvocations` directly, we can render cards immediately without waiting for another message.

## Testing

To verify the fixes work:

1. Start the dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Go to the assistant page
3. Type "quiero un seguro de viaje" or similar
4. You should see:
   - AI responds conversationally
   - Interactive cards appear immediately
   - Prices show in COP format
   - All plan details are complete

## Remaining Considerations

- The tool invocations approach may need adjustment based on how the AI SDK actually passes tool results
- Consider adding error boundaries around card rendering for better error handling
- May want to add loading states while tool is executing
