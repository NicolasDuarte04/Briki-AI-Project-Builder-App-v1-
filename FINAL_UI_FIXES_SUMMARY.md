# Final UI Fixes Summary - Insurance Cards

## Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. üîÅ "Cotizar ahora" Button Now Functional
- **Problem**: Button was using onClick handler that wasn't working
- **Solution**: Replaced Button component with proper `<a>` tag when external_link exists
- **Implementation**:
  ```jsx
  <a
    href={safePlan.external_link}
    target="_blank"
    rel="noopener noreferrer"
    className="..."
  >
    Cotizar ahora
    <ExternalLink className="h-4 w-4 ml-2" />
  </a>
  ```
- **Result**: Links now open in new tabs as expected

### 2. üé® Improved Provider Badge Visibility
- **Problem**: Provider name was too light and hard to read
- **Solution**: Enhanced styling with better contrast and shadow
- **New Style**:
  - Background: `bg-white/90` with shadow
  - Border: Clear border for definition
  - Font: Semibold for better readability
- **Result**: Provider names are now clearly visible

### 3. üìê Fixed Visual Overlapping
- **Problems Fixed**:
  - Tags overlapping with content
  - Title potentially clashing with tags
  - Provider badge spacing issues
- **Solutions**:
  - Added conditional rendering for tags (only show if they exist)
  - Added `pr-4` to title to prevent overlap
  - Changed card overflow from `hidden` to `visible`
  - Removed fixed `pr-20` from provider section
- **Result**: Clean layout without overlapping elements

- After: Blue-tinted background matching the brand

## Technical Changes
