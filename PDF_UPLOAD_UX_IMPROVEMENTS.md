- Includes both "Sign in" and "Create account" options

### 2. **AIAssistantInterface Component** ✅
- Chat functionality remains open to all users
- Guest users get a temporary session ID for chat
- Only PDF upload requires authentication
- Seamless experience for both authenticated and guest users

### 3. **Design System** 🎨
- Apple-like minimal design with Briki's blue-cyan gradient
- Rounded corners and soft shadows
- Lock icon to indicate secure feature
- Clear, friendly messaging in Spanish
- Responsive layout that works on all devices

## User Experience Flow

### For Unauthenticated Users:
1. Can use the AI chat assistant freely
2. When trying to upload PDF → Sees authentication prompt
3. Clear message: "Inicia sesión para analizar pólizas"
4. Two CTAs: "Iniciar sesión" or "Crear cuenta"

### For Authenticated Users:
1. Full access to all features
2. Can chat AND upload PDFs
3. Session automatically detected
4. Seamless experience

## Benefits

- **Inclusive Access**: Chat remains available to everyone
- **Clear Feature Boundaries**: Users understand which features require auth
- **Better Conversion**: Users can try the assistant before signing up
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Start with chat, upgrade for PDF analysis
- **No Confusion**: Clear messaging about what requires authentication

## Technical Implementation

```typescript
// Guest users can chat
if (!session?.user) {
  const sessionId = `guest-${Date.now()}`;
  setUserId(sessionId);
}

// PDF upload checks auth
if (!session?.user) {
  return <SignInPrompt />;
}
```
