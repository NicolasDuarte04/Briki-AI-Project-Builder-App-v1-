# Insurance Cards UI Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. üß± Cards in Narrow Container
- **Issue**: Cards were constrained to 80% width of the chat container
- **Fix**: Modified `AIAssistantInterface.tsx` to detect messages with insurance plans and render them at full width
- **Result**: Insurance cards now use the full available width

### 2. üî≤ Layout Changed to 2x2 Grid
- **Issue**: Cards were displaying in a 1x4 layout (4 columns)
- **Fix**: Updated `SuggestedPlans.tsx` grid from `lg:grid-cols-4` to `md:grid-cols-2`
- **Result**: Cards now display in a 2x2 grid on desktop, single column on mobile

### 3. ‚ùå 'Cotizar ahora' Button Not Clickable
- **Issue**: Button was disabled because `is_external` was defaulting to `false`
- **Fix**: Changed default value of `is_external` to `true` in `NewPlanCard.tsx`
- **Result**: Quote button is now clickable and opens external links

### 4. üî† Overlapping Elements
- **Issue**: Tags were overlapping with provider badge due to absolute positioning
- **Fix**: Added padding-right to provider section and padding-top to card header
- **Result**: Better spacing prevents overlap between elements

## Files Modified

1. **AIAssistantInterface.tsx**
   - Added logic to detect insurance plan messages
   - Applied full width to messages containing plans
